abstract = {The Green's functions of QCD are expanded in powers of the external momenta and of the quark masses. The Ward identities of chiral symmetry determine the expansion up to and including terms of order p4 (at fixed ratio mquarkp2) in terms of a few constants, which may be identified with the coupling constants of a unique effective low energy Lagrangian. The low energy representation of several Green's functions and form factors and of the ππ scattering amplitude are then calculated. The values of the low energy coupling constants are extracted from available experimental data. The corrections of order Mπ2 to the ππ scattering lengths and effective ranges turn out to be substantial and the improved low energy theorems agree very well with the measured phase shifts. The observed differences between the data and the uncorrected soft pion theorems may even be used to measure the scalar radius of the pion, which plays a central role in the low energy expansion.}

abstract = {In a previous paper, we have shown how to systematically determine the low-energy structure of the Green functions in QCD. The present article extends this framework to expansions in the mass of the strange quark. We construct the generating functional of U(3)×U(3) which allows us to calculate the Green functions up to and including terms of order p4 (at fixed radio mquarkp2) in terms of a few coupling constants which chiral symmetry leaves undetermined. We calculate the first non-leading term in the quark mass expansion of the order parameters 〈0|uu|0〉, 〈0|dd|0〉, 〈0|ss|0〉, and of the masses and decay constants in the pseudoscalar octet. The three coupling constants which are not fixed by experimental low-energy information are estimated by invoking large-Nc arguments.}
